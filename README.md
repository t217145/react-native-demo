## Getting Started
To start the application:
  1. Open the project on **vscode** and open the terminal. You may need to have **admin rights**.
  1. From the project root folder run the following command to restore all the dependencies:
        `yarn`
  1. Start development app using one of the following commands depending on the platform you want to run:

        **Windows**: `yarn windows`

        **Android**: `yarn android`

        **iOS**: `yarn ios`

### Run the sample on Windows 10

#### Requirements for React Native Windows
Make sure your computer satisfies all the system requirements listed in the [official documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnw-dependencies).

**Option 1**

1. You need to open a terminal or vscode with **administrator rights**.
2. Run the following commands:
    `yarn windows`
3. The tool will deploy the application on your machine, run it and launch the packager.

**Option 2**
1. Open the `windows` folder in File Explorer.
2. Double click on the `.sln` file to open the solution with Visual Studio 2019.
3. Double check in Configuration Manager that you're compiling the project with a suitable architecture for your computer (x86 or x64).
4. Right click on the project root project in Solution Explorer and choose **Deploy**.
5. Once the deploy is completed, open a terminal on the project root folder.
6. Run the following command:

    `yarn start`
7. Launch from the Start menu the app.

### Run the sample on iOS
#### Requirements
Make sure your computer satisfies all the system requirements listed in the [official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

Once you have the repo and the environment setup, you will just need to run:
```bash
    yarn react-native link
    yarn ios
```

*Note*: If navigation icons doesn´t display correctly you may need to go to ```ios``` folder and run ```pod install```

### Run the sample on Android
#### Requirements
Make sure your computer satisfies all the system requirements listed in the [official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

As a summary it should just work if after configuring your PC you just run:
```bash
    yarn react-native link
    yarn android
```
